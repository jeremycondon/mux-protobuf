# Mux Data Streaming View Exports

Mux Data can stream views for customers on Media plan to an Amazon Kinesis or Google Pub/Sub endpoint in the customerâ€™s cloud account. Views are sent to Kinesis or Pub/Sub as they complete and are made available to customers to retrieve from the stream within about one minute after the view ends. Protobuf definitions for consuming Mux Data streaming view exports are in `proto/exportstream.proto`.

See the [Mux Data Guide](https://docs.mux.com/guides/data/export-raw-video-view-data#stream-views-as-they-complete-beta) for more information on setting up streaming video exports
